# RAVE for WordPress

RAVE is an automated tool which facilitates being able to verify that packages provided by various distribution channels of WordPress are serving the legitimate code built from the canonical source code and that it hasn't been tampered with.

A CI system runs on GitHub Actions which verifies a number of official sources and a number of official and unofficial package distributions and compares them all against one another to identify any anomalies. A future version of this library will provide the tooling to run the checks outside of GitHub Actions.

RAVE stands for Reproduce And VErify.

## Why test the official package?

There are several opportunities for the official WordPress package to be tampered with so that it differs from the actual source code in the source control repos. This could come via an attack on the build server, on wordpress.org or downloads.wordpress.org, from external hackers, from those in control of the wordpress.org CDN, from disgruntled members of the meta or systems teams, from anyone who gains access to accounts or credentials of such team members, or from the project lead.

## Why test unofficial packages?

There are several opportunities for unofficial WordPress packages to be tampered with so they differ from the official package. This could come via an attack on the servers distributing the packages, from external hackers, from those in control of the packaging, or from anyone who gains access to accounts or credentials of people or processes involved in the packaging or distribution.

## How?

By comparing the output of the distributed package at its various locations with the output of building the source code from its various locations, we can identify anomalies between them. This reduces the opportunity for malicious or unwanted code to be introduced into WordPress packages without it also being present in the source repos.

If one of the GitHub Actions workflows in this repo fails, it should be investigated to see if the failure was caused by divergent code.

## Reproducible WordPress

From [reproducible-builds.org](https://reproducible-builds.org/):

> Reproducible builds are a set of software development practices that create an independently-verifiable path from source to binary code.

[The process that builds and packages WordPress](https://build.trac.wordpress.org/timeline) is reproducible, unfortunately the process itself is not open source. The process differs from the `npm run build` process in the source code because it makes some additions (eg. the Akismet plugin) and some exclusions (older default themes).

## Verifiable WordPress

The WordPress.org website [provides the md5 and sha1 hash of its WordPress package files](https://wordpress.org/download/releases/). This is not enough to verify a package, because the hash only represents the zip or tar file. If WordPress.org was compromised then its published md5 and sha1 hashes could also be altered.

The WordPress open source project does not make use of package signing which could be used to verify a package. [See ticket #39309 for discussion on this topic](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39309).

Therefore, this library has been created to provide a means of verifying that the contents of published packages matches the code in the official source code repos.

## What's not tested?

This approach does not enable detection of malicious or unwanted code that gets inserted into the Subversion or Git source code repos and makes it into the published package.

## To investigate

* WP-CLI
* https://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.7/
* APT packages, eg `apt install wordpress`
* wp-env
* What can we do with the md5 and sha1 hashes on .org?
* The container at https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress
